This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Plop

Plop is a generator which will create a skeleton of a new route or new component for you.

To use Plop, from `frontend`:

```bash
# route
npm run plop route
# Plop will ask you for a route path and will create a new folder inside of /src/app/

# component
npm run plop component
# Plop will ask you for a component name and will create a new .tsx component inside of /src/components and /__tests__/components
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```
